# iTunes_to_VLC

##Problem
I use iTunes to listen to my music because, I have an iphone. It makes it easier to have the same playlists, and music no matter the device. Unfortunately there is not a native iTunes app for linux, wine doesn't work with the windows iTunes app from my experience, and listening from the web player sounds absolutely terible. 

#Goal
Convert my iTunes play list to a youtube playlist to be downloadable via yt-dlp, so that I can use VLC media player to listen to my music and remake my playlists.

Notes: 
  -I would completely skip over the TLDR.txt, it is just a much shortened version of what is explained in the code files; but if you CBF it's there.
